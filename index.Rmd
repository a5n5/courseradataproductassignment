## Introduction

* This application was created as part of the Coursera Data Science Data Product Assignment.

* This is an application to calculate your Body Mass Index(BMI)

* The application allows you to enter your weight in lbs and height in inches, and it calculates your BMI

* It also provides a handy table to interpret your BMI

## Example BMI Calculation

The BMI formula is:

$\frac{weight ~X~ 703}{Height^2}$

where weight is in *lbs* and height is in *inches*

For example, for weight = 180 lbs and height = 70 inches, the bmi is
```{r,echo=FALSE}
h<-180
w<-70
bmi<- h*703/(w*w)
bmi
```

BMI       | Weight Status
----------|---------------
Below 18.5| Underweight
18.5-24.9 | Normal
25-29.9   | Overweight
30+       | Obese
